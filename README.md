# Mobile Project Smart Consult

This is the repository for the Mobile Project Smart Consult application.

## About the App

Smart Consult is an app designed to provide comprehensive healthcare consultations. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Symptom Selection**: First, you can select your symptoms, and the module within the app can diagnose what you are suffering from and suggest the necessary treatment.
2. **Chat with a Doctor**: If the initial consultation is not sufficient, you can chat with a doctor to get further consultation.
3. **Book an Appointment**: If needed, you can also book an appointment at any hospital and get a direct physical consultation.
4. **Report Sharing**: The hospital or doctor you chat with can view your report of what the model diagnosed you with and the treatment it suggested.
